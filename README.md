# Python Backend Development with FastAPI for User Management and To-Do Application

This repository contains a FastAPI backend application developed to address the challenge of creating a robust backend service for user management and to-do list functionality. This project integrates a database, implements user authentication, CRUD operations, and includes comprehensive documentation for API endpoints.

The primary objective of this challenge is to develop a FastAPI backend application with the following key features:

1. **Version Control Setup:**
   - Initialize a version control repository (e.g., Git) for the project.
   - Set up a remote repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. **Application Setup:**
   - Set up a FastAPI project for building the backend application.

3. **Database Integration:**
   - Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) for storing user and to-do data.
   - Create database tables and models for users and to-do items.

4. **User Authentication API:**
   - Implement API endpoints for user authentication, including registration, login, and password reset.
   - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

5. **User Profile API:**
   - Develop API endpoints for users to view and update their profiles.
   - Implement CRUD operations for user profiles.

6. **To-Do Management API:**
   - Create API endpoints for to-do management, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting to-do items.
   - Implement CRUD operations for to-do items.

7. **Authentication Middleware:**
   - Implement middleware to authenticate and authorize users using JWT for protected endpoints.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - Develop error handling mechanisms to provide informative responses for various scenarios, such as invalid authentication attempts and API errors.

9. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests and integration tests for the API endpoints to ensure functionality and security.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Create API documentation using tools like Swagger or ReDoc to describe the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

## Completion Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge, your project should meet the following criteria:

- A functional FastAPI backend application with API endpoints for user management (authentication, profile) and to-do management (CRUD operations).
- Integration of a database for storing user and to-do data, with tables and models defined.
- Secure user authentication using JWT tokens for registration, login, and password reset.
- Implementation of CRUD operations for user profiles and to-do items.
- Authentication middleware that protects endpoints requiring authentication.
- Effective error handling for informative API responses.
- Unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality and security of API endpoints.
- Comprehensive API documentation describing available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your database and configure the database connection in the project.

4. Run the FastAPI application:

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

5. Access the API documentation to explore and interact with the available endpoints by navigating to the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/docs` or `http://localhost:8000/redoc`).
